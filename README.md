# EDA PROJECT-HOTEL BOOKING ANALYSIS USING VISULALIZATION THROUGH MATPLOTLIB AND SEABORN
# DATA
Hotel bookings in particular time period

:types of customers

:bookings in different months

:bookings in different room types

:types of hotels

:stays in week,and weekends

:customer type

;deposit

:parking space used by clients

# SUMMARY
Here by ,i will bw working on the data set related to hotel bookings and its analysis in various variables upon which ,a useful conclusion will be drawn ‚Åâ

:using graphs and charts ,useful indights will be made

:bookings for the particular time shall be analysed.

:the base of my project will be to use the acquired knowledge of dataset and fetch workings and swot analysis , and make plans for same.

: the project is to direct my efforts to make a gist of important parameters.

:i will bw adjusting the data to need

:data will be trandformed into structured information to use,

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
My business objective is to draw useful insights from the given dataset in order to make better decisions,these will include the following steps which are to take place throughout my project:

:to draw useful charts and graphs which will itself show and visualise the important variable.

:to filter useful data and make resuklt out of it

:to make plans and policies out of data and working on it further.

# LIABRARIES USED:

NUMPY:
NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.

PANDAS:
 Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

 MATPLOTLIB
 Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible. Create publication quality plots. Make interactive figures that can zoom, pan, update.

 SEABORN
 Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data.
