FROM THE ABOVE DATASET ,ON THE BASIS OF VISULIZATIONS ,I CAN DRAW FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS AND INSIGHTS:

WE SAW THAT NUMBER OF BOOKINGS IN 2016 WERE 100% HIKED TO 2015,SO MAKE 2016 THEIR IDEAL YEAR AND WORK ACCORDING TO THAT

ROOM A SOLELY COMPRISED MORE THAN 50% BOOKINGS,SO INVEST MORE IN ROOM A TYPE

OTHER TYPES ROOMS CAPACITY WAS SOMEHOW UN UTILISES ,SO SWITCHING THEM TO ROOM A CAN BE BENEFICIAL

INVEST MORE IN CITY HOTELS,RESPONDING TO DEMAND

SEPTEMBER ,JULY,MAY ARE BULKIEST IN TERMS OF BOOKINGS,SO MORE ROOMS AVAILABILITY SHOULD BE DONE IN THESE MONTHS

PRT,GBR,FRA,ESP,DEU COMPRISED APPROX 50% BOOKING ,SO THESE COUNTRIES SHOULD BE FOCUSED MORE

ADULTS ARE MAJOR SOURCE OF BOOKINGS SAY MORE THAN 95% ,SO WE SHOULD FOCUS MORE OJN TRACTICS AND PRATICES THAT ATTRACT ADULTS ANS SATISFY THEM
